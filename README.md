# Overview

Welcome to my Java Software Portfolio. In this repo, I have a "Hello World" java program and a video of this basic program where I will demo the "Hello World" program. Also, I will have a full fledge program that creates a basic gradebook class and store the data into a file and then be able to read the datafile into the program for later modifications.

The purpose of this repo is to show my understanding of Java as required in CSE-310. Enjoy.
